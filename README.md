# My Python Journey 2.0 🚀

This repository is a personal record of my self-taught Python learning journey. It contains **71+ small Python exercises**, each in its own folder with a single `.py` script. These are hands-on programs I've written to practice and master fundamental concepts through consistent daily coding.

I started with basics like "Hello World" and progressed to more advanced topics like **recursion**, **matrix operations**, **lambda functions**, **file handling**, and simulations. Many concepts have multiple versions to show my iterations and improvements (e.g., several quadratic equation solvers or factorial implementations).

This is my way of building a strong foundation—one script at a time!

### Progress Highlights
- Started: Basic input/output and conditionals
- Covered: Loops, functions, recursion, string manipulation, math algorithms, data structures (lists, sets, matrices)
- Recent additions: File reading, complex numbers, set operations
- Total commits: 89 (as of December 2025)

### Topics Covered (Grouped)

#### Basics & Control Flow
- `helloworld`
- `even_or_odd`
- `positive_negetive_or_zero`
- `largest_of_three_numbers`
- `swapping_variables`
- `leap_year_or_not`

#### Arithmetic & Calculators
- `Simple_calculator`
- `basic-arthamatic-one-liner`
- `basic-arthamatic-with-different-formating-styles`
- `multiplication_tables`

#### Math & Number Theory
- Factorials (multiple versions, including recursion)
- GCD/LCM (brute force, recursion, while loop, formula)
- Prime numbers (check, in interval)
- Armstrong numbers (single, interval, practice)
- Fibonacci sequence (iterative and recursion)
- Sum of natural numbers/digits (recursive and iterative)
- Factors, square roots (including complex)

#### Conversions
- Temperature (Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit)
- Distance (km to miles)
- Number bases (binary, decimal, octal, hex – iterative and recursive)

#### Geometry & Equations
- Area of triangle (with base/height, validation)
- Quadratic equation solvers (multiple versions: basic, complex roots, cleaner output)

#### Strings & Text
- Palindrome check
- Vowel count
- Punctuation removal
- Extract words/first word
- Sort strings by first letter
- `chr()` and `ord()`

#### Functional Programming
- Multiple lambda practices (including with filter, reduce)

#### Data Structures & Operations
- Matrix addition, multiplication, transpose
- Set operations (union, intersection, difference)

#### Utilities & Simulations
- Calendar module
- Random numbers, dice simulators, shuffle deck of cards
- Complex number type exploration

#### File Handling & Misc
- `reading_files`
- `example_of_a_bad_code` (learning what not to do!)
- Various random experiments

### What's Next?
I'm continuing to add more scripts as I learn intermediate topics like **OOP**, **file I/O in depth**, **exceptions**, and small projects. Suggestions welcome!

Feel free to fork, star, or open issues if you spot improvements in any script. This repo motivates me—and hopefully inspires other self-learners!

**Happy Coding!** 🐍
